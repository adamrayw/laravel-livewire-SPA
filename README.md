# Livewire Single Page Application
Building modern web apps is hard. Tools like Vue and React are extremely powerful, but the complexity they add to a full-stack developer's workflow is insane.

Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.

It's not like anything you've seen before. The best way to understand it is to just look at the code. Strap on your snorkel, we're diving in.
